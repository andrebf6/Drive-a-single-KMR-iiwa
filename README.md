# Drive-a-single-KMR-iiwa
Repository containing software developed by Andrea Bravo Forn, as part of a final degree project in engineering physics performed at Federico II University (Naples, June 2021).

The aim of this project was to develop a collision avoidance strategy for two KMR iiwa robots naviganting in a warehouse environment. 
The KMR iiwa robot model developed by Charlotte Heggem, Nina Marie Wahl and Morten M. Dahl (as a specialization project in Robotics & Automation at NTNU) has been used.

The present repository contains a navigation algorithm to drive a single KMR iiwa robot in a warehouse environment.
In the repository andrebf6/Collision-avoidance-strategy-for-two-KMR-iiwa-robots-in-a-warehouse-crosssing, the implemented collision avoidance startegy for two KMR iiwa robots can be found.

  # Guide
  The repository contains the following packages:
   -  Ubuntu 18.04.3
   -  Python 3.6.9
   -  ROS2 Foxy Fitzroy
   -  Gazebo 11.0.0
  the user could specify several waypoints and the robot would follow a straight-line path from one point to another, in the order in which the waypoints were entered.
